That is because as employees their compensation is subject to withholding taxes and the School employer is subject to Social Security and Medicare contributions for their benefit. Further, as employees they are eligible for the Diocesan pension and healthcare benefits if their average weekly time worked exceeds 30 hours per week. However, if they are independent contractors, no such withholdings or contributions are applicable and they are not eligible for pension and health care benefits. Some 20 factors have been identified by the government as indicating whether an individual providing service is an employee or an independent contractor including among others: • Whether the entity (School) or the individual has the right to control and direct the means to perform the service, not just the results achieved. • Whether the service is done on the school’s premises, with tools or materials provided by the School. • Whether the service is performed on the School’s time schedule. • Whether the relationship between the School and the individual is continuing. • Whether the individual makes the service available to the general public. • Whether the individual provides the service to two or more parties in addition to the School. None of the 20 factors are individually controlling and the determination is based on the substance of the arrangement, not its form. Please contact Director of Human Resources before concluding that the individual is an independent contractor and not an employee. If an individual is determined to be an independent contractor, he/she must complete and sign an IRS Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. A letter outlining the deliverables and terms of payment should be prepared and signed prior to the individual commencing the service. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL Independent contractors are paid through the accounts payable system and must be issued an IRS Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, by January 31 for the previous calendar year. • Certificate. For any individual or contractor who enters the School premises to perform work, the School must obtain an insurance certificate from the contractor’s insurance agent, naming the School as an additional insured. This ensures that the contractor has adequate coverage and limits the School’s liability and exposure to loss. • Personal & Real Property Changes. Schools have the responsibility to notify the diocese’s insurer (currently Catholic Mutual) of all building and equipment additions or deletions in amounts in excess of $50,000. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.506 Credit Cards and Debit Cards School credit cards may be used to facilitate purchasing and to make use of the School’s sales tax exemption. Credit cards should be issued in the Principal’s name and may only be used for School activity. No personal expenditures are allowed. Credit card charges must be evidenced by a credit card receipt and a store receipt detailing the items purchased. Only principals are authorized to make purchases on behalf of the School. The Principal or the School Bookkeeper must examine the monthly credit card statement carefully, ensuring that purchases are appropriate and reasonable and that all individual charge slips/store receipts are filed with the monthly credit card statement. Credit card bills must be paid in full each month. Non-Bank Issued Credit Cards Credit cards that are not bank issued by the Diocese are allowed with approval from the Superintendent or the Director of Operations.  (ie, Home Depot) Schools are not permitted to use Debit Cards Debit cards appear similar to credit cards, but there is one significant difference: the bank does not assume any liability for unauthorized use. The owner of the debit card would have to pursue the unauthorized users for reimbursement, which could result in a lengthy and expensive process. Use of a debit card results in immediate withdrawal of funds from the account, facilitating immediate theft and postponing realization of theft, possibly until a bank statement is received. In addition, the use of a debit card by someone other than the principal effectively gives them check-signing authority, in contrast to the policy of the Diocesan authorized signers on bank accounts. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.507 Petty Cash Funds Petty cash funds are intended for purchases of less than $100.  The aggregate of all petty cash funds should not exceed $500. The petty cash custodian (e.g. the School Principal) is responsible for the petty cash fund. All purchases paid from a petty cash fund must be identified on the Petty Cash Reimbursement Request Form and supported by original receipt documentation indicating: o the amount of the expense. o the date of the expense. o the purpose of the expense. o the name of the person making the purchase. Reimbursements to the petty cash fund are made when necessary (when petty cash on hand is less than $100), normally twice a month. The petty cash fund is physically kept secure in the School safe or fireproof cabinet. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.508 Christmas Bonus Gifts Cash, checks and Gift Cards are taxable items and cannot be given without appropriate taxes being withheld from the employee. No Christmas Bonus can be given unless approved by the Superintendent and Chief Financial Officer. Bonuses must be in the budget for the school year. Bonuses may not be given by any school operating in a deficit. If Approved: • The bonus must be given in the form of a check only-no cash and no gift cards may be given. • The bonus must flow through the operating account to payroll with all appropriate taxes withheld and documented. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.509 Contracts Property. All property transactions must be reviewed by the Office of the Superintendent and approved and signed by the Superintendent. Goods and Services.

Principals of Diocesan School are NOT authorized signors. Diocesan Sponsored Elementary Schools All contracts are to be submitted to the Office of the Superintendent for review prior to signature by the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Diocesan Sponsored Elementary School. Renovations and Construction New construction or major renovations are governed under the approval process established by the Diocesan Building and Sacred Arts Committee. All projects totaling more than $50,000 must be submitted to the Diocesan Building and Sacred Arts Committee See the Building & Sacred Arts Commission Guidelines Binder for that process. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.510 Sales Tax Schools in the Diocese of Bridgeport are not-for-profit organizations and generally exempt from paying sales tax on purchases from retailers of tangible personal property or services in the State of Connecticut. Schools must provide retail vendors with a State of Connecticut Department of Revenue Services CERT-119 documenting the exemption prior to making purchases (see Appendix at the end of this chapter). Individuals purchasing on behalf of the School must be alert to ensure that tax is not charged at the time of purchase. Sales at School fundraising or social events by retailers (e.g. sales of food at a carnival by a restaurant) also are not exempt from sales tax. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.511 Recording and Reporting Recording and Reporting The standard Chart of Accounts is designed so that Schools may record their expenditures to specific natural expense categories (e.g. compensation, utilities). EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 1.512 Property and Equipment Tangible property and equipment that a School owns and uses in its activities and that has a useful life to the School of greater than one year is usually “capitalized”1 when acquired, rather than charged to expense. According to Diocesan policy, property and equipment costing, or with a value when donated, less than $2,499, are charged to expense, not capitalized. Property, excluding land, and equipment that is capitalized will be depreciated, that is charged to expense, ratably over the expected useful life of the asset. Land is not depreciated as it has an indeterminate useful life. 1 Capitalize: an accounting term referring to ongoing recognition of an expenditure or donation as an asset in financial statements

School personnel are instrumental in the development of each and every student as a Catholic person. It is through school employees, who act as ministers of the Catholic faith, that a school can cultivate a love of Christ in the hearts of its students. Canon Law states that Catholic “teachers must be outstanding in true doctrine and uprightness of life” (Canon 803). The U.S. bishops have reminded Catholic school leaders that this mandate applies to teachers in all disciplines. (National Directory for Catechesis, pp. 231, 233). In order to ensure that school personnel possess the knowledge and experiences needed to be ministers of faith and to allow for the opportunity for personal spiritual reflection and growth, a formation plan has been developed. Administrators and teachers must fulfill the current diocesan requirements as outlined by the Office of the Superintendent and the Catholic Leadership Institute. PROCEDURE Approved: July 1, 2013 Revised: October 14, 2015 It is the responsibility of the principal to ensure that the current diocesan guidelines are being met by those employed in their school. Religion teachers must be practicing Roman Catholics and be in good standing with their parish community. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 2.110 After-School Assistance/Tutoring During the Academic Year POLICY Approved: July 1, 2013 Revised: August 15, 2021 After-School Assistance As a part of his/her teaching responsibility, at least once a week each elementary school teacher is expected to offer after-school assistance to their students without additional compensation. Opportunities for after-school assistance in high schools shall be outlined in each high school’s parent/student handbook. Tutoring A teacher may not tutor (receive additional compensation for) any student that he/she currently teaches. If a teacher is hired to tutor students whom he/she does not currently teach, it is expected that he/she do so in an appropriate setting other than the school. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 2.111 Outside Employment and Activities POLICY Approved: July 1, 2013 Revised: October 14, 2015 Employees should not have outside employment or activities that interfere with school duties, faculty meetings, and/or professional development programs or with providing their best performance. Outside employment and activities must not be considered immoral or contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church and must not be considered as manifesting a conflict of interest with the Church, school, and Diocese of Bridgeport. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 2.112 Professional Development POLICY Approved: July 1, 2013 Revised: October 14, 2015 In order to provide effective leadership for Catholic schools, administrators, faculty, and staff are required to attend professional development in the form of workshops, seminars, and lectures that address school and diocesan goals.

Employees may work at multiple locations and remain part-time provided the regular total number of hours worked each week does not exceed 30 hours. Prior Approvals Required for Multiple Diocesan Positions Resulting in Full-Time Benefit Eligibility: When a part-time employee wishes to add a second position that will change their part time status to full time, (30 or more hours per week), the “manager” at both entities must approve this change in work status before an employee may accept the new position with the following requirements: 1. Employee advises current manager that he/she has been offered an additional role(s) that will result in working 30 hours or more per week. The current manager and the potential new manager must speak to reach agreement between the two entities with the following options: a. Current manager confirms they are able and willing to support the position changing to full time and the managers agree on the financial costs each will be responsible for, generally proportionate to the number of hours the individual is working at each entity divided by the total hours worked. For example, if an employee works 21 hours at parish one and 9 hours at parish two, parish one would pay 70% of the costs and parish two would pay 30%. b. Current manager confirms they are not able to support the position changing to full time. Manager of the second entity has the option to assume 100% of the benefits cost including medical, dental and pension. c. Current manager confirms they are not able to support the position changing to full time and manager of the second entity indicates they are not able to pay 100% of the benefit cost. This situation results in this work arrangement not being possible. The employee would then need to decide whether he/she wants to stay in position one or resign from position one to accept position two. Documentation Required for Full Time Employee with Multiple Employment Locations: EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL When an employee becomes benefit eligible based on multiple positions, and the “managers” have agreed how to support the benefits financially, the arrangement must be documented and acknowledged by both managers. Documentation must be sent to HR for confirmation of appropriate benefit rates and will be filed in the employee personnel file. An employee may not “waive” insurance eligibility in order to work two or more part-time roles upon learning that benefits are not financially viable for the employer. While a full time employee may initially decline health benefits, he/she is able to add health benefits either during a subsequent annual Open Enrollment or at the occurrence of a qualifying life event. Additionally, a full time employee is eligible for and must receive 401(a) retirement contributions whether or not they elect medical benefits. Reduction of a Full Time Employee to Part Time: Managers may consider reducing a full time employee’s hours to part time which results in a loss of benefit eligibility. Such reductions should only be done under the guidance and with the close involvement of HR. If at any time, a manager learns an employee is working 30 hours or more across multiple positions, without manager approval, the manager should contact HR to determine the appropriate resolution. Loss of benefits may also result from an employee no longer having one of multiple positions. If an employer discontinues having regularly scheduled work hours of 30 hours or more per week, the employee must immediately advise their manager(s) of this change in status. For reductions that result in loss of benefits, eligibility will cease effective the first day of the month following the change in status to part time. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 2.121 Employment at Will POLICY Approved: July 1, 2013 Non-contractual employment with the diocese is at-will, and may be terminated by the employeeor the employer at any time with or without reason. EFFECTIVE DATE AUGUST 15, 2021 v••FINANCE & PERSONNEL MANUAL 2.122 Resignation POLICY Approved: July 1, 2013 Revised: September 30, 2015 Employees who do not have a contract with the school may cease employment at any time for anycause.
