Frank J. Caggiano       Deacon Patrick Toole Bishop of Bridgeport         Chancellor I. INTRODUCTION  A. Diocese of Bridgeport  Since February 25, 1978, over 160 men have been ordained to the Permanent Diaconate for the Diocese. While each of these men expresses his life of service in various ways, all deacons share a common purpose in their ministry. The deacon’s ministry is:  . . . to bring God’s Word to believer and unbeliever alike, to preside over public prayer, to baptize, to assist at marriages and officiate at them, to give viaticum to the dying, and to lead the rites of burial. Once he is consecrated by the laying on of hands . . . he will perform works of charity in the name of the Bishop. . . Furthermore [he will] faithfully pray the Liturgy of the Hours daily for the Church and for the whole world.1 1 The Rites Book Volume II, Ordination of a Deacon, Paragraph 14  Most permanent deacons have family responsibilities and earn their living in the secular world. It is important that the deacon seek balance in his life: being an ordained minister of Christ the Servant in the world, while also performing his duties as spouse, father, son, neighbor, and worker. Such a balance can only be achieved with excellent communication between the deacon and his wife, the bishop, his pastor, and other collaborators in ministry.  This manual is intended to facilitate the desired balance described above by offering an explanation of the deacon’s responsibilities in and to the Diocese of Bridgeport by virtue of his assignment, appropriate mutual expectations of the deacon and those in collaborative ministry, their individual and mutual rights, duties, and their anticipated and obligatory mutual fraternal support.   II. MINISTERIAL DUTIES OF THE DEACON  A. Vocation and Ministry of the Diaconate  In order to better understand the role and mission of a deacon in the life of the Church, one must begin with the Church’s teaching regarding the sacrament of Holy Orders that the deacon receives and shares. The bishops of the United States, in their document The National Directory for the Formation, Ministry, and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States (NDPD) (2021), describe the sacrament of Holy Orders in the following way:  “Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles [and their successors] continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time.” Thus, it is the sacrament of apostolic ministry: “The mission of the Apostles, which the Lord Jesus continues to entrust to the Pastors of his people, is a true service, significantly referred to in Sacred Scripture as ‘diakonia,’ namely, service or ministry.” This diakonia “is exercised on different levels by those who from antiquity have been called bishops, priests and deacons.” “The ordained ministries, apart from the persons who receive them, are a grace for the entire Church.” “These two terms – apostle and servant – go together. They can never be separated. They are like the two sides of a medal. Those who proclaim Jesus are called to serve, and those who serve proclaim Jesus.”2 2 NDPD, 25 3 NDPD, 30  As an integral part of the sacrament of Holy Orders, the diaconate configures a man to Christ as Servant, constituting him as a member of the hierarchy and sacred minister of Christ “with a distinct identity and integrity in the Church that marks him as neither a lay person nor a priest; rather, the deacon is a cleric who is ordained to diakonia, namely, a service to God’s People in communion with the diocesan bishop and his body of priests. “The principal function of the deacon, therefore, is to collaborate with the bishop and the priests in the exercise of a ministry which is not of their own wisdom but of the Word of God, calling all to conversion and holiness.””3  The deacons of the church are the sacramental sign of Christ’s ministry of service on behalf of the Church and the world, serving the discipleship of God’s people. Through his witness and service, each deacon is called to be a living icon of Christ the servant, who “did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mt. 20:28, NAB).  In order to live his ministry well, the deacon should be formed by his spiritual participation in the life, death and resurrection of Christ. The deacon must never forget that he does not serve with his gifts and talents alone but through the power of Christ alive in and through his diaconal ministry.  Ministerial opportunities for the deacon whose identity is properly formed in Christ are many. The deacon’s primary foundational and principle relationship is with the Bishop and his co-workers, his pastors. Each deacon also enjoys a special bond of charity with his bishop, allowing the bishop to care for those most in need through each deacon’s ministry of charity and service. As a close collaborator with his pastor and sharer in Holy Orders, deacons and priests must minister together as brothers in every respect, to help God’s people to grow in greater love of Christ and a deeper personal sanctification in service to the world.   Deacons are also called to create unity, working with and in their community, to build up the Kingdom of God in the world. Diaconal ministry also supports the laity’s participation in the apostolic mission of the church. The deacon does not fulfill his obligations by simply doing the work himself; rather he is to facilitate the participation of the people in this important enterprise of the Church. Deacons are called to live and foster “servant leadership” in every aspect of the Church’s life.  The deacon must also serve those who live on the periphery of society, especially the poor and the infirm, the indifferent, the alienated, the unwanted, the disenfranchised and those whom the culture considers expendable.  The liturgical ministry of the deacon should be a reflection of what he does among the People of God outside of the liturgy.  By virtue of their ordination, deacons become members of the clergy, with the rights and responsibilities that follow from that position. They are a unique instance of the clergy; since most of them are married, have secular careers, and do not engage in the Church’s ministry as their sole activity. This combination of an ordained ministry with marriage and secular occupation can be a great strength to their ministry and great opportunity for the Church as a whole. Deacons are uniquely qualified to represent the presence of the Church to the world and the needs and challenges of the world to the Church.4  4 NDPD, 61  B. The Threefold Ministry of the Diaconate  Deacons are called to live a threefold ministry in the following way:  Ministry of the Word  The deacon is called to be a man of deep prayer, becoming familiar with and a witness to the Word of God in his ministry, among his family and in the workplace. He is to love, preach and teach Sacred Scripture from the pulpit and in his daily life with honesty, integrity, and courage. A deacon is called to teach and catechize his fellow Catholics and help prepare those seeking to receive the sacraments, especially adults seeking initiation into the Catholic Church.  In order to fulfill this ministry, the deacon must always remain a student of God’s Word, for only when the Word of God is deeply rooted in his own life can the deacon bring that Word to others. The deacon ought to remember that since he is a member of the hierarchy, his actions and public pronouncements involve the Church and its Magisterium. Therefore, he is obligated to protect the communion and mission that bind him to the Holy Father and his own bishop, especially in his preaching of the Scriptures, the Creed, Catholic teachings and the disciplines of the Church.  The deacon has the faculty to preach when he is the presiding minister of a sacrament or liturgical rite: . Appropriate parts of the Order of Christian Initiation of Adults . Baptism of Children . Rite of Marriage . Visitation and Communion of the Sick . Funerals: at a Vigil Service or Rite of Christian Burial (apart from Mass) and in the Rite of Committal . Communion Services . Liturgy of the Hours . Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament  The deacon may preach at the following liturgies and occasions: . Celebration of the Eucharist with approval of the Celebrant . Celebration of a sacrament when he is not the presiding minister of that sacrament.  This does not include Baptisms during the celebration of a Mass. . Retreats, days of recollection, missions, and novenas. . Reflections to be given at ecumenical gatherings or services  In those instances where a deacon may wish to be a minister of a liturgical celebration in a parish or institution other than where he is assigned within the Diocese of Bridgeport (e.g., Marriage, Baptism, Funeral), he must first obtain the proper delegation or permission from the pastor where he will minister. If the liturgical celebration is outside the Diocese Bridgeport, the deacon must contact the Office of Clergy so that the proper documentation can be prepared and presented to the host pastor.  Ministry of the Altar  Every deacon is called to serve the Sacrament of Christ’s Body and Blood by his proper participation at the celebration of Mass, his love and reverence for the Blessed Sacrament and his willingness to bring the Eucharist to those who are sick and unable to join the community of faith in Sunday worship. “After the priest, the deacon, in virtue of the sacred Ordination he has received, holds first place among those who minister in the celebration of the Eucharist. For the sacred Order of the Diaconate has been held in high honor in the Church even from the early times of the Apostles.”5  5Third Edition of the Roman Missal, Chapter III, #94  By virtue of his ordination, a deacon may preside at a number of liturgical services including: baptizing infants, witnessing marriages, conducting wakes, presiding at funeral services outside of Mass, Communion Services, Exposition and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and assisting at the celebration of Mass. Each deacon must also cultivate a profound love and reverence for the Sacrament of Christ’s Body and Blood. Such a Eucharistic spirituality is essential in the ministries described above.  Ministry of Charity  Deacons serve as Christ’s heralds of hope and love to the poor, disabled, needy, lonely, forgotten and outcast. Through their witness and service, deacons are to promote works of mercy, justice, reconciliation and peace. Each deacon must strive to challenge fellow believers to address the social needs of the poor (both material and spiritual) and to meet such needs.  As an ordained participant in the Church’s ministry of charity, the deacon assumes the duties entrusted to him by his diocesan bishop with humility and enthusiasm. At the core of his spirituality, a deacon puts on Christ and is guided by the love of Christ in caring for all in his charge: “Charity is the very soul of ecclesial communion. This charity is universal, and the deacon looks to human need in its broadest sense. The deacon is to cultivate an imagination that takes him to the heart of human need. In a real sense the ministry of a deacon is not limited to any particular service; instead his missionary service is agile and deliberative. The deacon is attentive to human pain in all its forms as he discerns that portion of the Gospel to be poured into the wounds of human suffering (Lk 10:34). As Pope Benedict XVI noted, “In these years new forms of poverty have emerged. . . . Beside material poverty, we also find spiritual and cultural poverty. . . . Be servants of the Truth in order to be messengers of the joy that God desires to give to every human being.” As a man sent from the diocesan bishop in the name of Christ the Servant, the deacon holds within his heart a vision of charity as wide and deep as the one held in the heart of Christ.6  6 NDPD, 90 7 NDPD, 91  “In the prayer of diaconal ordination, the diocesan bishop implores God that the deacon may be “full of all the virtues, sincere in charity, solicitous towards the weak and the poor, humble in their service . . . [and] may . . . be the image of your Son who did not come to be served but to serve.” Therefore, “by word and example,” the deacon places himself “at the constant service of [his] brothers and sisters.” This service includes diocesan and parochial works of charity, including the Church’s concern for social justice. It also extends into Christian formation - working with youth and adults and transforming the world through personal witness in conformity with the Gospel of life and justice. The deacon must strive, therefore, to serve all of humanity “without discrimination, while devoting particular care to the suffering and the sinful.” Ultimately, the deacon’s principal diakonia – a sign of the Church’s mission – “should bring [all whom he serves] to an experience of God’s love and move [them] to conversion by opening [their] heart[s] to the work of grace.””7   Other works of charity may include prison ministry, nursing home ministry, helping in soup kitchens, hospital chaplaincy, visiting the homebound or working with immigrants. By virtue of their routine presence in the marketplace, deacons often have the opportunity to be resourceful and accessible in their service.  Unity of Diaconal Service  The Church has always taught that the threefold ministry that marks the life and work of the diaconate forms a single whole whose parts can never be compromised or lost.  “Therefore, “the diaconal ministries, distinguished above are not to be separated; the deacon is ordained for them all, and no one should be ordained who is not prepared to undertake each in some way.” “However, even if this inherent ministerial service is one and the same in every case, nevertheless, the concrete ways of carrying it out are diverse; these must be suggested, in each case, by the different pastoral situations of the single churches.” A deacon may also have greater abilities in one aspect of ministry; and, therefore, his service may be marked by one of them more than by the others. Fundamentally however, there is an intrinsic unity in a deacon’s ministry. In preaching the Word, he is involved in every kind of missionary outreach. In sanctifying God’s People through the Liturgy, he infuses and elevates people with new meaning and with a Christian worldview. In bringing Christ’s Reign into every stratum of society, the deacon develops a Christian conscience among all people of good will, motivating their service and commitment to the sanctity of human life.”8  8 NDPD, 41  C. The Spirituality of Deacons  Spirituality in the Life of a Deacon  A deacon cultivates his spiritual life through private and communal prayer, attendance at daily Mass whenever possible, frequent reception of the Sacrament of Reconciliation and regular meetings with a spiritual director in order to attain a vibrant personal relationship with the Lord.  Spiritual Requirements  Liturgy of the Hours  Each deacon is obliged to pray Morning and Evening Prayer. The Office of Readings, Daytime Prayer and Night Prayer, while not obligatory, should be incorporated into a deacon’s schedule when possible. The Liturgy of the Hours may be prayed privately or in community with others.  Spiritual Direction  All deacons must be in frequent contact with a spiritual director who can be a guide on the journey to grow closer to the Lord. Each deacon is strongly encouraged to submit the name of their spiritual director to the Office of the Diaconate where the information will be kept on file.  Personal Prayer  To attain an interior spiritual maturity requires an intense sacramental and prayer life. In addition to the daily recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, personal prayer is to be part of a deacon’s daily experience and may include lectio divina, the rosary, and reading of private devotions.  Spiritual Expectations  Daily Mass  Depending on his schedule, a deacon is strongly encouraged to participate in the daily reception of the Eucharist, which is the summit and source of his growth in holiness. Frequent reception of the Eucharist allows Christ to nourish the deacon as he serves the people of God.  Regular Confessor  All deacons are encouraged to have a confessor to whom they confess on a regular basis.   III. THE DIACONATE WITHIN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH  A. The Deacon and His Bishop  “The deacon exercises his ministry within a specific pastoral context: the communion and mission of a diocesan Church. He is in direct relationship with the diocesan bishop with whom he is in communion and under whose authority he is assigned to exercise his ministry. In making his promise of respect and obedience to his diocesan bishop, the deacon takes as his model Christ, who became the Servant of his Father. The diocesan bishop also enters into a relationship with the deacon because the deacon is his collaborator in the service of God’s people. It is, therefore, a particular responsibility of the diocesan bishop to provide for the pastoral care of the deacons of his diocese. The diocesan bishop discharges this responsibility both personally and through the Director of the Permanent Diaconate.”9  9 NDPD, 43  By virtue of his ordination, a deacon is canonically incardinated into the Diocese of Bridgeport, and should consider him available to serve where the needs of the Diocese exist, as discerned by the bishop.  It is the bishop who assigns a deacon to a particular diocesan ministry. The criteria for each assignment include the pastoral needs of the diocese and local communities, the personal qualifications and abilities of the deacon and the needs of his family and work responsibilities.  The bishop is also responsible for supervising the ministerial life of deacons.   It is, therefore, a particular responsibility of the diocesan bishop to provide for the pastoral care of the deacons of his diocese. The diocesan bishop discharges this responsibility both personally and through the Director of the Permanent Diaconate.   He should, therefore, encourage and support them in their work, involve them in the committees and councils that assist him in the pastoral care of the diocese, promote their spiritual lives by having spiritual counselors available in the Diocese and through the Office of Diaconate, in his name, provides continuing educational and formational programs for them.  B. The Deacon and His Parish  Deacons exercise their distinct ministry in communion not only with their diocesan bishop, but also with the priests who serve the diocesan Church. The priesthood and the diaconate are neither identical nor competitive but complementary ministries. “The diaconate is not an abridged or substitute form of the priesthood; it is a full order in its own right.”10 Both priest and deacon should understand, then, that the diaconate is not to be thought of or exercised on the model of the priesthood. “Deacons and priests, as ordained ministers, should develop a genuine respect for each other, witnessing to the communion and mission they share with one another and with the diocesan bishop in mutual service to the People of God.”11 Priesthood and diaconate are thus two distinct ministries for the good of the Church, and they must be exercised in communion with one another. 10 NDPD, 54 11 NDPD, 57  Deacons are to make every effort to assist and support their pastors. Deacons must always collaborate with their pastors, the spiritual and administrative leader of the parish, along with other clergy members and parochial staff.  The priorities of family, employment, and ministry should be consistently reiterated and reinforced. A Deacon Ministerial Agreement, which is drawn up between the deacon and his pastor, and acknowledged by his wife, will help to define these priorities properly.  C. The Deacon and the Larger Community  Deacons are uniquely qualified to represent the presence of the Church to the world and the needs and challenges of the world to the Church. They are a Bridge between the Church and community. A Deacon is in a unique position as ambassador in the larger, secular world. Although most deacons will give only part of their time to formal parish or diocesan diaconal ministries, they should not neglect the opportunities they have to exercise a public ministry in the world or in the marketplace. They do not cease to be deacons when they pursue their secular occupations, and there is much that they can do in the secular sphere precisely as deacons. The diaconate is a ministry through which the needs of the world are brought to the Church, and the gifts the Church has to offer are brought to the world. This mediating role can be made visible in powerful ways by the manner in which the deacon handles his secular career and his civic and public responsibilities. In turn, deacons should be able to bring to the Church the appreciation of the meaning and value of the Gospel that derives from their regular and deep involvement in the world, bearing as they do both the questions the world has to pose and the unique insights secular activity can provide.  D. The Deacon and the Diaconal Community  It is part of Holy Orders that a man is, by this sacrament, brought into the “ordo” or body of ordained ministers. A communal element is thus essential to ordination and to the exercise of ordained ministry. At a minimum, there is an expectation that deacons would attend scheduled events (i.e. Convocation, Bishop-led discussions, etc.) and prayer services to build fraternity. The mutual support and fraternity of deacons are not just sociologically or psychologically useful things; they are integral parts of the meaning of their vocation.  Deacons are encouraged to cultivate a sense of community among themselves and their families. Deacons’ wives and widows are also encouraged to create a community of prayer and support with one another and their husbands. As a community, deacons and their wives should make every reasonable effort to attend diocesan functions, diaconal retreats, and funerals of their fellow deacons, wives, and family members.   IV. ASSIGNMENT/REASSIGNMENT/RETIREMENT  A. Assignment to Ministry   General Norms The Diocesan Bishop makes all diaconal assignments for ministry in the Diocese. Ordinarily, the bishop will seek some input from the Vicar General, the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious, the Director of the Diaconate and the pastor of his proposed assignment. The deacon is to accept willingly and in a Christian and professional manner whatever parish ministry the bishop assigns him. There should be no expectation upon ordination that the deacon should be assigned to his representative parish. The Bishop maintains the final decision on the needs of the Diocese and where a deacon should be assigned.  The bishop may need to give a deacon more than one assignment. However, no deacon will be assigned to multiple assignments without the opportunity to provide input to the Bishop, Vicar General and the Director of the Diaconate regarding the feasibility of fulfilling all that will be expected of him.  All assignments become official with a letter of appointment from the bishop.  Term of Assignment  Ordinarily, all diaconal assignments, whether they are for newly ordained deacons or a change in assignment for presently ordained deacons, will be for a term of five (5) years. Terms can be renewed without limit. The duration of an assignment can also be extended or shortened at the sole discretion of the Bishop.  At the end of each term, an in-person meeting will take place between the pastor and the deacon before an additional five-year term is granted. There must be a mutual agreement between both parties before the new term is put in place. Any health related reasons for not completing their current term or committing to the next term must be fully outlined and described in a letter to the Bishop. Supporting documentation from a physician may also be required  Ministerial Expectations  The deacon is expected to provide a reasonable number of hours of parish and/or public ministry, based on his agreement with his pastor—depending on the deacon’s health and his family and career situation—and should be documented in his ministerial agreement ordinarily not to exceed 12 hours each month. These hours do not include homily preparation time. Additionally, whenever possible, he should assist at a minimum of two parish Masses per weekend.  Ordinarily, the deacon is granted the faculty to preach upon ordination and should be allowed to preach at a minimum of two weekend Masses per month. If the situation warrants it, the deacon should be encouraged to preach more often. As an example, deacons should have the opportunity to preach at weekday Masses when they are available to do so. The deacon should also be scheduled in the rotation for the pre-baptismal classes and the baptisms of the parish.  The deacon’s hours of participation in parish ministry will involve more hours at such times as Christmas, Holy Week, Easter and special parish celebrations such as First Holy Communion and Confirmation. In order to assist the deacon in his assignment and to grow in his ministry, the pastor:  . Will release his deacon from any parish responsibilities upon requests from the Bishop, so that he can participate in an annual spiritual retreat, the annual convocation, continuing education opportunities and assisting the Bishop at the Sunday celebration of the Mass at the Cathedral at his request. . Will support a deacon’s time for ministries beyond the parish to include prison and hospital/nursing home ministry, hospice, Cursillo, Engaged Encounter, etc. . When possible, should provide or assist in the purchase of vestments required to carry out the liturgical role of the deacon. . Should provide access to an area in which the work of instruction, counseling, study and preparation can be performed by the deacon. . Will not expect a deacon to perform a role within the parish that will create an undo financial burden in order to successfully perform that role . Will allow a minimum of four weekends off per year as personal vacation time. Other needs for time off can be negotiated with the pastor.  Wife & Family Participation  Wives and children of deacons are called upon to sacrifice quality time with their husband and father for the good of Christ and the Church. Children of deacons should not be treated any differently from other children. The wives of deacons should not be expected to become any more involved in church activities than they wish. At the same time, the deacon must also remember that he is ordained to serve and should not take excessive vacation or undue time off. Family members as well as deacons themselves must keep in mind that they are all “public” figures in the parish.  Procedure for the Assignment of Newly Ordained Deacons  Ordinarily, after a candidate for diaconate is called to ordination, he will learn of his parish assignment directly from the bishop or his delegate, in a meeting with his wife. As part of the process of assigning the new deacon, the deacon and his wife also will meet with the Director of the Diaconate.  Newly ordained deacons should schedule a meeting with their newly assigned pastor as soon as possible after receiving their assignment letter to discuss ministry opportunities in the parish. Upon ordination, the deacon is granted all the rights stated in the Code of Canon Law and carries out all the duties assigned to him by his pastor.  The pastor will assign the deacon ministries in the parish according to its needs. However, the deacon should be active in the life of the parish and perceive other ways in which he may bring his own gifts to parish life or public ministry, after consultation with the pastor.  Appointment of Deacon Mentor  All newly ordained deacons are assigned a deacon mentor as proposed by the Director of the Diaconate and approved by the Bishop. The role of the mentor will be one of assistance and guidance for the newly ordained as they enter into pastoral ministry as an ordained minister of the Church.  B. Reassignment of a Deacon Reassignment When Initiated by the Bishop  Because deacons are ordained for ministry for the entire diocese, periodic transfers will occur. When considering the pastoral needs of the diocese’s parishes, institutions and ministries, the bishop may transfer deacons in accord with those needs. Transfers also may be initiated by the pastor or the deacon himself at any time for good cause.  When the bishop, through the Vicar General or Dean, asks a deacon to transfer, the Vicar General or Dean will alert the current and new pastors of the change, and the deacon himself will interview with the new pastor.  Reassignment When Initiated by the Deacon  In order to initiate a transfer, a deacon must first consult with his wife and children about the change. He should then meet with the local Dean, who will either propose a plan to remedy any difficulties that may be prompting the request for transfer or expedite the transfer. The deacon should inform his pastor of his plans and submit a formal request for transfer in a letter to the bishop. When transfers are made, among the factors to be considered are the needs of the Church, the location of the assignment, the skills and talents of the deacon, his family’s needs and his availability.  Reassignment When Initiated by the Deacon’s Pastor  If a pastor desires the transfer of a deacon, he will follow the same procedure as outlined in the section immediately above. After meeting with the local Dean, followed by the deacon himself, the pastor will submit a formal request for the transfer of the deacon in a letter to the bishop.    Resolution of Ministerial Disagreements  If a serious conflict of any kind arises between the deacon and his pastor, the deacon must request a face-to-face discussion with his pastor. If the conflict is not resolved, the deacon must then contact his respective Dean to discuss the matter. The Dean will then contact the pastor and attempt to resolve the issue. A meeting with the deacon, his pastor and the dean will follow. If necessary, the Vicar General will be consulted.  If the source of conflict cannot be resolved, then a transfer may be initiated either by the deacon or by the pastor, following the procedures outlined above.  Evidence of any wrongdoing by a priest, deacon or pastor should be reported immediately to the Vicar General.  C. Other Ministerial Assignments   Leave of Absence For a serious cause, whether it is personal, spiritual or familial, a deacon may ask for a leave of absence from ministry for a determined period of time. Such a request must be discussed with the deacon’s pastor before any petition is submitted to the bishop. If the deacon chooses to request a leave of absence, his petition must be made in writing to the bishop, who will ordinarily meet with the deacon and his wife to discuss the request. If granted, such a leave will be governed by the condition(s) that will be stated in a letter to be sent to the deacon by the bishop.  Ordinarily, when a deacon takes a leave of absence from ministry, he will return to his former assignment upon cessation of the leave. In special circumstances, the bishop or deacon may request that the deacon be given a new assignment upon his return.  Sabbatical  A one-time, three-month sabbatical period may be taken during or after the calendar year of the deacon’s 15th anniversary of diaconate ordination prior to retirement. Exceptions to this norm must be approved by the Diocesan Bishop.  The following conditions are to be observed for the three-month sabbatical leave:  1. A written request must be made to the Diocesan Bishop via the Director of the Diaconate one year in advance of the intended sabbatical period. The request should include the dates and location of the desired sabbatical, as well as information on the sponsoring institution, the program of study and goals of the sabbatical period.  Due to the obligations of full time work for many active deacons, this sabbatical period may also be used as a time for rest and personal study. 2. Upon receiving permission from the Diocesan Bishop, the deacon must notify his pastor or supervisor. A pastor must notify the proper Dean, who will work with the pastor to find coverage for the parish. 3. During the sabbatical period, the parish or institution to which the deacon is assigned will pay his full stipend for those deacons who were ordained before 1/1/2024 and are eligible to receive the monthly stipend; in addition, it will provide an educational allowance ($200/month) to assist with room, board and expenses during the sabbatical leave, which may include fees and tuition for online study programs as a part of the deacon’s request for personal study and reflection. 4. It is assumed that deacons who are granted a sabbatical leave will resume the pastoral position they had prior to the beginning of the leave, unless another arrangement has been made with the Diocesan Bishop. 5. At the conclusion of the sabbatical leave, the deacon should provide a written evaluation and the results of the sabbatical to the Vicar for Clergy or the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious, so that his personnel file may be updated.  Deacons Without Assignments  A deacon may be without an assignment for a number of reasons. They include but are not limited to:  1. Deacons on short-term health leave: short-term leave (understood as less than one year) occurs when a deacon, due to medical or psychological causes, must take time off from his assignment in order to address these same causes (e.g. major surgery, serious auto accident, cancer treatment, etc.). This will be handled on a case-by-case basis.  The ability to stably exercise diaconal ministry is determined by the Bishop in consultation with the deacon and, whenever necessary, medical professionals. 2. Deacons who are disabled and unable to exercise diaconal ministry: a disabled deacon who cannot exercise even part-time ministry is understood to be a deacon who is not capable of exercising public diaconal ministry due to a mental or physical illness or injury. The ability to stably exercise diaconal ministry, even part-time, is determined by the Bishop in consultation with the deacon and, whenever necessary, medical professionals. 3. Deacons on administrative leave or on a voluntary leave of absence: administrative leave arises when the actions of a deacon make it impossible for him to continue in active ministry such that he is directed to step away from active ministry (e.g. active alcoholism, narcotic use, etc.).  Voluntary leave arises when the same circumstances exist, but the deacon chooses to step away from diaconal ministries. 4. Deacons who refuse an assignment: deacons should undertake and fulfill faithfully any function which the Bishop entrusts to them.  If a deacon, who is otherwise capable, absolutely refuses to comply with a legitimate request that is deemed necessary by the Bishop, he is deemed to be unfit for that role by the fact that he refuses to comply.  The Bishop may consider the deacon to be incapable of ministry and place him on administrative leave.  If possible, the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious or the Director of the Diaconate should confer monthly with these deacons.    Service Outside of the Diocese  A formal request for transfer to a ministry outside the diocese must be made to the Bishop with a copy sent to his respective Dean and the Vicar General. The letter must include the reasons for his proposed departure from the diocese, a description of the ministry that is being sought and an indication of the duration of the proposed ministry. If the move is employment-related, the letter must include the reasons for the move, such as a promotion or change in employer (refer to Appendix D, pp. 43-44).  If the bishop approves the deacon’s request to seek ministry outside of the diocese, the deacon must then ask permission of the diocesan bishop in his new diocese. The deacon must receive the permission of the bishop of the new diocese that the faculties he is requesting have been granted to him before exercising faculties there.  Any deacon seeking a ministerial assignment outside of the Diocese of Bridgeport will be regarded as being on a temporary leave, for five years before any excardination and incardination process can begin.  If a deacon has retired from active employment and he and his family are planning to relocate to a new diocese, he must write a letter to the bishop as outlined above.  Incardination Process  A deacon who is in good standing in another diocese and seeks incardination into the Diocese of Bridgeport must submit a formal request for incardination to the Diocesan Bishop with a copy to the Vicar General. The specifics for the request must be stated in the letter. If the move is employment-related, the letter must include the reasons for the move. The arriving deacon must also ask permission of his current bishop to leave active ministry in his home diocese.  Before his petition for incardination can be processed, the deacon’s former diocese will be asked to provide a statement of suitability for ministry for the deacon. All safe environment requirements must also be met in full before the deacon’s petition can be acted upon.  Once approved for entry into the diocese, the arriving deacon will be granted an assignment(s) on a temporary basis for five years before the excardination and incardination process can begin. (refer to Appendix D).  D. Other Ministerial Considerations   Deacon Ministerial Agreement At the beginning of a new assignment, every five years or when a new pastor is assigned to the parish, the deacon and pastor should draw up a “Deacon Ministerial Agreement.” This provides the pastor and the deacon the opportunity to review and agree upon the deacon’s ministerial responsibilities. (Cf. Appendix B). The agreement must be acknowledged and initialed by the deacon’s spouse.  An annual review should be held between the pastor and the deacon. Furthermore, the diaconate office will contact each deacon in active ministry to receive feedback on the adherence to the agreement including input of his spouse.  For non-parish assignments appointed by the diocesan bishop (hospital chaplain, prison chaplain, high school chaplain, etc.), an annual review should be held between the Director of the Diaconate and the deacon.   Political Office  “A deacon may not present his name for election to any public office or in any other general election, or accept a nomination or an appointment to public office, without the prior written permission of the diocesan bishop. A deacon may not actively and publicly participate in another’s political campaign without prior written permission of the diocesan bishop.12 12 NDPD, 96 / canon 285 §3 and 287 §2  Proper Address  The appropriate written title for permanent deacons is “Deacon John Doe”. Deacons should be addressed as “Deacon.”  Clerical Identification  Upon ordination, a deacon should receive a clerical identification card with a photo and signature.    Proper Dress for Ministerial Work  In a public forum, deacons who possess the faculties of the Diocese of Bridgeport are permitted to wear clerical attire in the following ministerial situations: hospital or prison ministry, nursing home visitations, wake services, interments when alb/stole is not practical, providing spiritual direction, and in civil gatherings or ecumenical celebrations where the deacon is an official representative of the Roman Catholic Church. Clerical attire in these situations is either a black or blue shirt with Roman collar.  When ministering within the deacon’s parish, he is permitted to wear a blue shirt with a Roman collar. Furthermore, when assisting at Mass, Baptisms, etc., black pants and black shoes are the only appropriate dress.  Deacons serving as a Master of Ceremonies for the bishop will wear a cassock and surplice with Roman collar, black pants and black shoes.  Diocesan Email Address  Upon ordination, each deacon will be assigned a diocesan email address ending in .diobpt.org. This email address must be used exclusively to transmit and receive all official electronic diocesan correspondence. It is expected that each deacon regularly consult his email account to remain fully informed of diocesan-related matters. Forwarding emails from your diocesan provided email account to any third-party email system, including your own personal email, is considered a violation of the Diocesan Security policy and is strictly prohibited.  Social Media  Deacons who use social media should do so to evangelize, catechize and share the Good News of the Gospel. They should be careful never to convey messages that could be misconstrued or considered provocative, intentionally divisive, scandalous or overtly politically partisan. Deacons should take care to avoid commenting on such topics on any social media outlets or platforms. When posting on social media in any capacity, deacons should remember they are “public” persons and, therefore, their opinions reflect on the diaconate, the Church and the Diocese. Any opinion shared by a deacon could be taken by media outlets as an “official position” of the Church, even though it may not have been intended to be so.  Deacons should contact the Office of Communication before making public statements or being interviewed in the mass media.  Use of the Dalmatic  The proper vestment for a deacon at Mass is an alb (with an amice if required), cincture, stole worn in the diaconal manner, and dalmatic. The stole and dalmatic should be of the corresponding liturgical color.  With respect to its habitual use, the dalmatic is to the Deacon what the chasuble is to the Priest. Therefore, in most cases the deacon may use the dalmatic only when the priest would use the chasuble. An exception to this rule is when a deacon accompanies a bishop or priest who wears a cope in a solemn celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours or for Benediction with the Blessed Sacrament.  There are no ritual situations in which a deacon would use the dalmatic on his own; it is only used when carrying out his functions accompanying a bishop or priest. Therefore, just as a priest would not use the chasuble for a Communion service, the deacon would not use a dalmatic. The same may be said of other celebrations of sacraments and sacramentals, such as funeral services outside of Mass.  The proper vestment for celebrations such as baptisms, weddings, funerals and the like outside of Mass is an alb and stole of the appropriate liturgical color.  E. Retirement   Normal Retirement All deacons are required to submit a letter of resignation from their ministerial assignments to the bishop upon reaching their 75th birthday. Upon his 71st birthday, either for personal, family or health reasons, he may submit a letter of petitioning retirement, pending approval of the Bishop. Once a deacon retires, the obligatory monthly stipend will end. A retired deacon in good standing will retain his diaconal faculties and will be referred to as “Active Retired.” A Ministerial Agreement would then be created between the deacon and the pastor of the parish he will support and should be reviewed annually to assure the recommended assignments would not negatively impact the health of the deacon.  Early Retirement  A deacon may submit a written request to the bishop to retire prior to age seventy-one, after consulting with his pastor, informing his Dean and meeting with the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious. Additionally, any deacon who has not attained the age of seventy-one but whose ability to serve in active ministry has been permanently impaired because of ill health, other disability or personal reasons, may retire with the consent of the bishop. In either case, the deacon shall submit his written request for retirement directly to the bishop.  Effect of Retirement  Even though a deacon retires, he remains a deacon in the service of Christ and the Church. For this reason, he should continue to fulfill the spiritual obligations of his state in life. A retired deacon, and his wife, will always be welcome at all diaconate functions including the annual retreat and convocations. He remains a member of the Diaconal Community because he is an ordained cleric for life. He should also continue to be addressed as “Deacon.”  Whether the deacon has taken early or normal retirement he shall retain the faculties granted to him. As such, he is encouraged to continue to baptize, preach, and assist in the Burial Rites of the Church and other ministries, with the permission of the local pastor. An Active Retired deacon would remain in communication within the Deanery where his parish ministry is active. A fully retired deacon remains in communication with the Deacon Representative for Retired Deacons.  To witness a marriage, the retired deacon must be delegated for a specific marriage by the pastor of the parish where the marriage is to take place.   V. BENEFITS OFFERED TO DIOCESAN DEACONS  Monthly Stipend  Effective January 1, 2024, a monthly stipend will no longer be provided to a deacon ordained after this date. Pastors are reminded to not create any unnecessary financial obligations on any deacon in order to perform their assigned duties.    If significant expenses were to occur and there is a need to cover these expenses, the deacon should be reimbursed as per the parish policy with regards to collecting necessary receipts and mileage incurred using their personal auto.  It is important to note, transport or personal mileage to and from the parish, as well as travel within the normal duties of ministry, would not be considered a legitimate expense and should not be reimbursed.  The current obligation of the monthly stipend of $300 will remain in place for all deacons ordained before January 1, 2024 until the deacon formally retires in writing and the Bishop accepts his letter of resignation.  Pastors have the discretion to set the range of stipends above $300, if they choose, depending on the financial health of the parish.  Retreats  A deacon is required to make an annual retreat, for a minimum period of one weekend. Based on actual cost, a deacon is entitled to a maximum reimbursement of $600.00 each year from his place of assignment for retreat expenses. This reimbursement includes an approximation for mileage expense to and from retreat center. The deacon must submit a written request for the reimbursement indicating the location and the total cost. Receipt is required.   Gifts  Any free-will offering given to a deacon on the occasion of a ministerial service is to be retained by the deacon. However, any offerings intended for any other purpose (parish, charity, etc.) should be honored as such.  Life Insurance  Each deacon is covered by a $10,000 life insurance policy. The deacon will receive a beneficiary card from the diocese, on which he must designate his choice of beneficiary of this policy. The diocese pays the premium for this coverage.  Burial Plot  All deacons and their wives are entitled to a free burial plot or niche in the cemeteries managed by the Catholic Cemeteries of the Diocese of Bridgeport. Interment fees are also waived for deacons and their wives. Costs for memorialization are the responsibility of the deacon’s estate. If a deacon or his wife have already purchased a burial plot in one of the Diocesan Catholic Cemeteries, they can request a refund from the Cemetery Office.  Full-Time Employment by Diocese or Parish  To avoid conflicts of interest, ordinarily a deacon will not be employed by the same parish where he is assigned for his diaconal ministry, except with the approval of the bishop.  A deacon who is a salaried employee of a parish or a diocesan agency (e.g., DRE, Parish Manager, instructor in diaconate formation) will have his income reported in the usual manner. If he is a full-time employee, he is entitled to a salary and health, dental, and pension benefits commensurate with the norms of that position.    VI. LITURGICAL NORMS AND PROCEDURES  These are general guidelines of liturgical norms for deacons. A more complete explanation of the liturgical responsibilities and duties of the deacon can be found in the sacramental norms.  The Celebration of Baptism  Deacons are ordinary ministers of the Sacrament of Baptism and enjoy faculties to baptize. However, this faculty is exercised only with the consent of the pastor of the parish where the baptism takes place, including the parish to which he is currently assigned, and shall only take place outside of the celebration of the Mass.  Care must be taken to see that the baptism is correctly noted in the baptismal register of the parish where the sacrament is performed.  The Celebration of Weddings  A deacon who officiates at marriages within the diocese must currently have faculties from the Bishop and must have the written delegation of the pastor of the parish within which the wedding will take place if the marriage is to take place outside of his home parish. Without this delegation, the marriage will not only be illicit but invalid. Further, the couple to be married must present a marriage license issued by the appropriate civil authority, or in the case of a convalidation, a certificate of marriage outside the Catholic Church.  Deacons from outside the diocese must comply with all diocesan safe environment requirements, and have a letter of good standing sent to the pastor of the parish where the wedding will take place, and seek delegation from the pastor of the parish. A deacon who officiates at marriages outside the diocese must call the Office of Clergy or the Office of the Diaconate and obtain a letter of good standing that will be sent to the pastor where the wedding will take place.  Participation at Mass with a Priest Celebrant  When a deacon is present at the celebration of the Eucharist, a deacon should exercise his ministry, wearing an alb, stole of the appropriate liturgical color and a dalmatic (if available).  More specifically, the deacon:  . Assists the priest and processes at his side; . Proclaims the Gospel and may, at the direction of the celebrant, preach; . Ordinarily leads the intentions of the Universal Prayer; . Ministers at the altar, both as regards the chalice and the Roman Missal; . Assists the priest celebrant in distributing Holy Communion; . Purifies and arranges the sacred vessels; . Carries out the duties of other ministers, if necessary, when none of them is present.  Participation at Mass with a Bishop   The Bishop will require two deacons to assist him at all Diocesan, Pontifical Masses and Sunday morning Masses at the Cathedral when he is the main celebrant. Instructions for the procession and responsibilities during the Mass will be delivered by the Master of Ceremonies just prior to the Mass celebration.  VII. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR DEACONS AND THEIR FAMILIES  A. Marriage Counseling  Any permanent deacon whose marriage is undergoing serious stress should make this known to his spiritual director. If this problem cannot be resolved with the guidance of his director, the deacon’s pastor and local dean should be informed of the situation. Arrangements should be made for immediate counseling.  If the situation persists, the Dean will consult with the Vicar General. It may be recommended that the deacon ask for a leave of absence. If counseling results in a favorable outcome, the deacon may request permission to return to ministry, in writing, to the bishop. In the case of an unfavorable result leading to a legal separation or divorce, the deacon may be kept on a leave of absence depending on the particular circumstances. He may or may not be permitted to return to ministry to exercise his functions as a deacon. The deacon must petition in writing to the bishop, copying the Vicar General, for his permission to return to ministry, which will be at the discretion of the bishop. In cases of separation or divorce, it is of the utmost importance that the rights of all parties be respected and any appearance of impropriety and/or scandal to the diocese and the Church be avoided. In this regard the deacon is to submit to the Vicar General all legal documents that have been submitted to the civil courts. After careful review, the Vicar General will make recommendations to the bishop concerning action to be taken concerning the status of the deacon. Until these recommendations are made, the deacon, at the discretion of the bishop, will continue on a leave of absence. Once the recommendations have been made to the bishop, it will be solely his authority to determine the status of the deacon during the separation and divorce proceedings. Each case will be treated on an individual basis and the utmost confidentiality will be exercised in these matters.  B. Family Counseling  The tremendous demands made on marriages today can often be heightened by the additional challenge of ministry. Should any member of the diaconal community need the services of a trained counselor, the deacon must contact the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious or Vicar General for assistance. A directory of offices and counselors to contact is available through the Office of Catholic Charities.  C. Widowers and Widowed Wives  All deacons should be attentive to the needs of deacon widowers and widowed wives of deacons. If any deacon becomes aware of a particular need of a deacon widower or a deacon’s widow, he should make such need known to the Vicar General.  D. Assistance to Deacons and Widows in Need – Deacon Fund  If a deacon becomes aware of a brother deacon or widow of a deacon in need, he should, as much as possible, offer support and encouragement. Also, he should make the need known to the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious. Should the need be financial, he should make the deacon or the widow aware of the Deacon Fund (“The Fund”).  The Fund is intended to support deacons in need with financial contributions made by deacons. This is deacons helping deacons. This special deacon fund is your testimony to your whole hearted dedication and commitment to your brothers and sisters, who can no longer meet the financial challenges of everyday living.   The distribution of The Fund will be based on need and availability of funds.  A request must be submitted either in writing or via email to the Director of the Diaconate specifying the reason for financial need of the deacon or the widow and the amount requested.  The distribution of funds must be approved by the Bishop, the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious, and the Director of the Diaconate.  Currently, the amount allocated to a deacon, or a widow who requests financial assistance shall not exceed 10% of the total funds available. At the discretion of the bishop, a higher amount may be approved.  A yearly report will be sent to all deacons and benefactors detailing the current balance of The Fund, summarizing transactions over the past year, and seeking their ongoing support for the following year. This report will be prepared by the Director of the Diaconate, submitted to the Bishop, reviewed, and sent with his annual Deacon Fund letter to all deacons.  A thank you note acknowledging receipt of a donation will be immediately sent to the donor from the Office of the Diaconate.  In all cases, confidentiality will be maintained.  E. Personal Health Care  With all of the demands placed on a deacon’s daily life and increased responsibilities, caring for the health of his family and himself must be a priority. All deacons are encouraged to have proper health care insurance coverage and participate in regular or at least an annual physical examination. Proper treatment and following medical advice will prevent health deterioration and will allow the deacon to care for the welfare of his family and himself. (Refer to Appendix E)  When unfortunate adverse medical situations occur, and after the proper medical care has been sought, should the deacon feel that he needs assistance or intervention, such need should be made known to the Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious. The Episcopal Delegate for Clergy and Religious or Vicar General will communicate this information to the bishop who will make a recommendation of any action to be taken. Confidentiality will be maintained at all times and in every instance.  F. Last Will and Testament  Deacons should not write the last will and testament of any person and shall avoid the appearance of any undue influence on others who are making their last will and testament.  Without permission of the bishop, a deacon shall not act as guardian, administrator, executor, trustee or agent for anyone except a member of his immediate family.   VIII. CONTINUING EDUCATION AND FORMATION OF DEACONS  Under the direction of the Director of the Diaconate, and with the support of the Institute for Catholic Formation, a comprehensive and holistic program for the ongoing training, theological formation, and ministerial and spiritual support of deacons will be created. This includes the development and implementation of a mandatory three year continuing formation curriculum for all newly ordained deacons. In addition, all deacons are required to participate in on-going formation on an annual basis as specified by the Director of the Diaconate.  As these programs are created, their requirements will be communicated in a timely manner with the deacons of the Diocese and the men in formation. It is the expectation of the bishop that all deacons cooperate fully with whatever is required for ongoing training and formation.   IX. SAFE ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS  A. Preamble  In accord with the “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People,” the USCCB promulgated “Essential Norms for Diocesan/Eparchial Policies Dealing with the Allegations of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Priests or Deacons” as approved by the Apostolic See. The Charter addresses the Church’s commitment to deal appropriately and effectively with cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests, deacons, and other church personnel.  B. Requirements  In the Diocese of Bridgeport, a Safe Environments Program has been in place since 2003 and it has made great strides in prevention, detection and early intervention efforts.  Clergy are held to higher standards of behavior than other church personnel and are required to comply with standards of behavior included and specified in the Diocesan Safe Environments Program; they are expected to avoid even the appearance of impropriety both inside and outside the scope of their ministry. This applies to all clergy and men in formation.  With that mandate, the bishop has issued a newly revised and updated set of guidelines and procedures that are consistent with the revisions to the USCCB Charter. The updated Safe Environment Handbook should be read and understood by every member of the clergy.  Every deacon in the Diocese of Bridgeport must comply with the requirements of this handbook or he will not be allowed to function in the Diocese.   X. MINISTERIAL MISCONDUCT  A. Introduction  The Bishop has put into place policy and norms for the assignment of clerics with an allegation of ministerial misconduct that applies to all clerics serving in the Diocese.  B. Overview of Policy  These ministerial misconduct norms apply to all cases when a cleric is accused of (1) misconduct involving another adult or (2) misconduct in the exercise of his ministry. In such instances, the bishop will rely on these norms in considering action regarding the cleric’s assignment, including removal or suspension of his assignment, as well as any reassignment of the cleric.  These norms are presented for both the protection of the community of the faithful and for the maintenance and protection of the integrity of the Sacrament of Holy Orders. A priest or deacon who is accused of ministerial misconduct is to be accorded the presumption of innocence during the investigation of the allegation and all appropriate actions are to be taken to protect his reputation. If the allegation is deemed not credible, every step possible is to be taken to restore his good name, should it have been harmed.  Any allegation of misconduct subject to these norms will result in an internal investigation to determine the relevant facts and information surrounding the allegation. Based on a complete review of this information, there will be a determination as to whether the allegation is credible. Once an allegation is deemed to be credible based on the facts and information available, the Bishop may choose to convene the Ministerial Advisory Board in order to assist him in assessing the plan of action to address the misconduct and the conditions regarding assignment of the cleric involved.  For more details as to how this policy is applied and the process to be followed, please refer to the latest release of the diocesan Policy.   XI. THE DEATH OF A DEACON  A. Diaconal Funeral Arrangement Sheet  Each deacon should complete a funeral arrangement sheet that is to be provided by the Office of the Diaconate. See Appendix C – Planning Sheet for a Deacon’s Funeral.  A deacon’s funeral arrangement sheet will list his family requests, personal requests and his stated preferences relative to his burial arrangements. It also includes items such as preferred homilists, special concelebrants, assisting deacons and readings and music to be chosen.  Please note that the funeral arrangement sheet is not the deacon’s last will and testament.  Each deacon is asked to complete his funeral arrangement sheet and submit it to the Office of the Diaconate upon ordination. The sheet will remain in each deacon’s file and may be updated as needed. Each deacon should keep a copy for his own records.  B. General Procedures  Initial Notification of a Deacon’s Death  Upon the death of a deacon, his family is to contact the pastor of the parish where the deacon was assigned. The pastor will notify both the local dean and the Vicar General’s Office. For a retired deacon, his family is to contact the pastor of the parish in which the deacon resided and that pastor will contact both the local Dean and the Vicar General’s office.  Responsibilities of the Vicar General’s Office  . The Vicar General’s Office will then coordinate the arrangements for the wake and funeral of the deceased deacon with his pastor and family. The family of the deceased deacon should not finalize any funeral arrangements until the family is contacted by the Vicar General’s Office.  . The Vicar General’s Office will first notify the Bishop’s Office to try to accommodate the date of the funeral with the bishop’s calendar. If the diocesan bishop is not able to celebrate the Funeral Mass, the Vicar General should preside.  . The Vicar General’s Office will contact the pastor of the parish regarding the details of the Funeral Mass.  . The Vicar General’s Office will notify the Public Information Office so the appropriate official diocesan obituary notice may be posted. This notice is separate from the notice that is placed by the family in other newspapers.  . The Vicar General’s Office will notify the Office of Clergy Personnel of the funeral arrangements for a deacon so that the diaconal community may be notified.  . The Vicar General’s Office will notify all the appropriate diocesan agencies of the funeral arrangements and complete the memorandum that is to be sent to all the parishes of the diocese. The Chancellor’s Office will request a death certificate that is kept in the deacon’s personnel file.  Responsibilities of the Pastor  In addition to contacting the Vicar General’s office, the pastor can appoint himself or another staff member to act as liaison between the family, parish and Liturgy office. This person will be responsible for the proper arrangements of all the liturgical events.  C. General Considerations Regarding the Funeral Rites   General Principles a. Rites to be Celebrated: Regarding the rituals that comprise the funeral services for a deceased deacon, the rites ordinarily celebrated are: i. Gathering in the presence of the body at the funeral home/church, for the wake service. ii. Transfer of the body (if applicable) from the funeral home to the church. iii. Funeral Mass iv. Rite of Committal b. Role of deacons: inclusion of the deacons in the various funeral rites is to be encouraged to express the ministry of deacons and the unity of those ordained to the order of deacon.  It is customary for all available deacons to gather and pray Morning Prayer together on the morning of the deacon’s funeral. c. Language Consideration: When planning the funeral rites, considerations should be given to any language needs manifested by the family and parish. d. Music: “Music is integral to the funeral rites.” It should be selected “with great care.” The music “should support, console, and uplift the participants and should help to create in them a spirit of hope in Christ’s victory over death and in the Christian’s share in that victory.”13  e. The Wake of a Deacon: A deceased deacon can be waked either in a funeral home selected by his family, or in a church. A deacon may request to have his wake occur in the church to which he was assigned. This would require the pastor’s approval. However, there will be no Mass of Transferal. 13 OCF, #30, #31  The deacon should be waked in white vestments proper to his order (i.e. alb, stole and dalmatic).  All liturgical norms listed below for the wake service should be observed. . When the family first gathers in the presence of the body at the funeral home, the Rite of Gathering in the presence of the body should be celebrated. . Evening Prayer of the Dead (OCF, #385-395) may be celebrated as appropriate. The vigil service should be celebrated the night before the Funeral Mass.  The local Dean presides at this ceremony. . On the day of the Funeral Mass, the family and close friends gather at the funeral home in order to prepare to accompany the body of the deceased deacon to the church, The Rite of Transfer of the Body to the Church should be prayed. If one is available a deacon or a priest should lead this rite. (Omit if wake occurs in church)  The Funeral of a Deacon  The Bishop is the principal celebrant of the Funeral Mass. If prevented from being present for any reason, the Vicar General will be the principal celebrant.  The Funeral Mass is ordinarily celebrated in the church to which the deacon was assigned. Deacons who were not assigned to a parish will have their funerals celebrated in their home parishes, unless the deacon or his family has made some other specific request.  The pastor of the parish and the dean will be included with the special concelebrants that have been designated by the deacon or his family.  The homilist, previously chosen by the deceased deacon, can be a priest, deacon, or bishop.  Final Commendation of a Deacon  The bishop or, in his absence, the pastor will give the final commendation.   XII.

The Council will raise awareness of the vocation of the deacon in the life of the Church. The deacon by his ordination is asked to embody and manifest Jesus the Servant within the community of believers. Our diaconal service should “inspire, and enthuse the faithful, giving them courage and strength, that they, in turn, may serve their brothers and sisters in the imitation of Christ.”14   Article III: Membership The Council is a working group drawn from the diaconate community of the Diocese of Bridgeport.
